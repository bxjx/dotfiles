" Things i'm always forgetting:
" gj moves down to next wrapped line (same with g$ etc) - this is now default!
" gq3j gq reformats the line - alias to <leader>q
" <leader>cs will comment out selected text
" ead expands each with block, see also eai, cla
" mA sets a global mark. 'A will return to it
" :h for help and :bd to shut buffer (i used to type :help all the time!)
" I to edit at start of line
" W jump code grouping
" z for code folding
